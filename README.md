## Game-play

This is a modern take on the classic game Space Invaders but with a few differences. First of all, the player has an 
option of choosing the colour of a ship. Secondly, enemies have different movement: first stage is moving from
left to right and vice-versa, while second stage is somewhat(pseudo) randomized and based on sin function. Thirdly,
enemies shoot randomly and allowed to have unlimited amount of bullets on a screen. Last and not least, the less enemies are on a
screen more they shoot.
